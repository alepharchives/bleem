# Introduction

While I read about [Bloom](http://bloom-lang.net) and the current implementation
[Bud](http://github.com/bloom-lang/bud) in Ruby, I go along implementing Bloom
in Erlang, not yet as a DSL, but rather as modules as see how far I can get with
that. Hopefully it helps to understand how Bloom wants to work better.

For now, I get the idea to actually convert this project over to Scala as DSL
support is rather good there too.
