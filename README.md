# Introduction

While I read about [http://bloom-lang.net](Bloom) and the current implementation
[http://github.com/bloom-lang/bud](Bud) in Ruby, I go along implementing Bloom
in Erlang, not yet as a DSL, but rather as modules as see how far I can get with
that. Hopefully it helps to understand how Bloom wants to work better.
